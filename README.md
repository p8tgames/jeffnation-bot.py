WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS "CURRENCY" BRANCH AS DAILY. IT IS A TESTING BRANCH FOR AN CURRENCY SYSTEM

# Help us.
If you got any changes that could make the bot better, please create an commit. You will be credited.

# What's this sudo/owner file?
An leftover from my old bot which it is based on. Sudos serve no function now, they can only use the test commands to check if the settings system works.

# ToDo
Make code more readable for beginners. Add comments, remake old and bad code and make every message embedded.

# How To get it running
It's just 3 simple steps:

1) Download [python](https://python.org).
2) Run the setup.py script.
3) Run the bot.
